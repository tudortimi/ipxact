- think how I want to handle the dependency to pyxb
  * for the moment, I'll just deploy it together with my code
  * is it acceptable to force users to install this lib too?
    ** it's open source, MIT license (or something permissive)
    ** JavaXB works the same way, it's just part of the standard lib

- enhance expression types with value returning functions of proper types
  * need an SV expression parser

- add semantic checks
  * references defined in one file are available
