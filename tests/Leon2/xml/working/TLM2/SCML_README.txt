Due to licensing restrictions, the SCML library should be downloaded by each person needing to use it.

The SCML kit is required for compiling and running the Platform-Mix variant of the example

The files can be found at:

http://www.coware.com/solutions/scml_kit.php

You have the choice between two versions of the SCML source code kit:
- PV only
- PV and OCP TL2

The second option is intended for members of OCP-IP. That kit contains OCP-IP TL2 channels and PV/OCP transactors.
The PV only option is sufficient for this example.

All files in the SCML kit are referenced from the root of the SCML kit installation directory represented as $SCML_HOME.
The include dir of the SystemC kit is referenced as $SYSTEMC_HOME
